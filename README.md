# About
This is playground with examples of written COMs in .Net and calls from C++ using Windows API (mostly from Ole32.dll) CoCreateInstance and CoGetObjectClass. COM is also implementing custom Marshallers for retrieving customizable content via pointers from C++ (like passing object with non-standard way of retrieving data from it etc.).

Primarly written as playground for marshalling and using Clarion QUEUE's in .Net.
